*What is backend development and how is it different from frontend development?*
Backend development refers to the server-side of web development, focusing on the logic, database integration, and server configuration. It's different from frontend development, which focuses on the client-side, dealing with user interface, user experience, and client-side logic.

*Three backend programming languages:*
1. Python
2. Java
3. Node.js (JavaScript)

*What is a server? Explain its role in backend development.*
A server is a computer or system that provides services, data, or resources to other computers or devices over a network. In backend development, a server hosts the application, handles requests, and provides data to clients.

*Define an API and explain its purpose.*
An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of defined rules and protocols that enables different applications to communicate with each other. Its purpose is to provide a standardized interface for data exchange and integration.

*What is a database and why is it important in backend systems?*
A database is a collection of organized data stored in a way that allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation. It's crucial in backend systems for storing, managing, and retrieving data.

*Two differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:*
1. SQL databases are relational, while NoSQL databases are non-relational/document-based.
2. SQL databases have fixed schemas, while NoSQL databases have dynamic or flexible schemas.

*What is a backend framework? Mention one example.*
A backend framework is a software framework that provides a structure for building web applications, simplifying tasks like routing, templating, and database integration. Example: Express.js (Node.js)

*Explain what HTTP is and why it is important.*
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol for transferring data over the web. It's essential for communication between clients and servers, enabling data exchange and web functionality.

*Two responsibilities of a backend developer:*
1. Designing and implementing server-side logic
2. Integrating with databases and APIs

*What does CRUD stand for? Explain each word.*
CRUD stands for:
- Create: Creating new data or resources
- Read: Retrieving existing data or resources
- Update: Modifying existing data or resources
- Delete: Deleting data or resources

*What is authentication and why is it important for backend applications?*
Authentication is the process of verifying user identity, typically through credentials like username and password. It's crucial for securing applications, controlling access, and protecting user data.

*What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request?*
A GET request retrieves data from a server, while a POST request sends data to a server for processing or storage. GET requests are typically used for fetching data, while POST requests are used for creating or updating data.


Section B:
JavaScript variables & Datatypes

*What is a variable in JavaScript?*
A variable is a container that stores a value, allowing you to reference and manipulate it in your code.

*Three ways to declare variables in JavaScript:*
1. `var x = 10;`
2. `let y = 20;`
3. `const z = 30;`

*Difference between let and const:*
- `let` declares a variable that can be reassigned.
- `const` declares a constant variable that cannot be reassigned.

*Seven primitive datatypes in JavaScript:*
1. String
2. Number
3. Boolean
4. Null
5. Undefined
6. Symbol
7. BigInt

*Datatype of the value: true*
Boolean

*Datatype of a JavaScript array*
Object

*Example of a string in JavaScript*
`"hello world"`

*Example of a number in JavaScript*
`42`

*Output of this expression? typeof "123"*
"string"

*Difference between null and undefined:*
- `null` represents a deliberate absence of value, often assigned explicitly.
- `undefined` represents an uninitialized or non-existent variable/property, often the default state.

Section C:
Coding.

*1. Declare a variable using let and assign your name to it.*
let name = "John Doe";
*2. Write JavaScript code to add two numbers and log the result.*
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 20;
let sum = num1 + num2;
console.log(sum); // Output: 30
*3. Create an object called student with properties: name, age, and department.*
let student = {
  name: "Jane Doe",
  age: 20,
  department: "Computer Science"
};
*4. Write a JavaScript function called greet() that prints "Hello World".*
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello World");
}
greet(); // Output: Hello World
*5. Write a program that checks if a number is even or odd.*
let num = 10;
if (num % 2 === 0) {
  console.log("Even");
} else {
  console.log("Odd");
}
*6. Create an array of 5 colors and print the first color.*
let colors = ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Yellow", "Purple"];
console.log(colors[0]); // Output: Red
*7. Write a function that returns the square of a number passed into it.*
function square(num) {
  return num * num;
}
console.log(square(5)); // Output: 25
*8. Write a small code snippet that converts a string to a number.*
let value = "42";
let numValue = Number(value);
console.log(numValue); // Output: 42
// or
let numValue2 = parseInt(value);
console.log(numValue2); // Output: 42
